{{ block content }}

    <p>
        In this experiment, you will make decisions related to carbon consumption and long-term investments under changing market conditions. The goal is to explore how fluctuating carbon prices influence your willingness to adopt carbon-saving measures and how fixed prices might encourage long-term investment.
    </p>

    <h2>Game Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The game simulates a long-term decision you need to make, which also impacts carbon emissions, such as buying a car. In this simulation, you receive a monthly salary from which you pay for your car. If you choose an oil-consuming car, its long-term cost will depend on fluctuating oil prices, which cannot be predicted ahead of time. Alternatively, an oil-free car, such as an electric vehicle, may cost more, but has predictable future costs.<br><br>
        The game consists of <span class="highlight">100 rounds</span>, including <span class="highlight">20 decision rounds</span> spaced every 5 rounds. In each round, you will receive an initial endowment of <b>{{C.ENDOWMENT}}</b>, representing your salary, and pay for one of two options:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Option 1: OIL-FREE Alternative:</b> A fixed payment of <span class="highlight">{{C.OIL_FREE_COST}}</span>.</li>
        <li><b>Option 2: OIL:</b> A cost that fluctuates to simulate real-world market conditions but is generally lower than the OIL-FREE alternative.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Your choice will depend on a bidding process.
    </p>

    <h2>The Bidding Process</h2>
    <p>
        Every 5 rounds, during a "Decision Round," you will bid on how much you are willing to pay for the OIL option. This decision is long-term, persisting for the next 5 rounds. If your bid is accepted, you will get the OIL option for those rounds. Otherwise, you will receive the OIL-FREE alternative.<br><br>
        Your bid is compared to a random number between <b>0</b> and <b>{{C.BID_MAX_THRESHOLD}}</b>. If your bid is higher or equal to that number, you win the OIL option. Otherwise, you receive the OIL-FREE alternative.<br><br>
        For example, a bid of 10,000 guarantees you win the OIL option (100% chance). A bid of 4,000 gives you a 40% chance of winning.<br><br>
        If you win the bid, you must pay the bid amount in addition to the OIL cost.
    </p>

    <h2>Example</h2>
    <p>
        Suppose the OIL cost is <b>3456</b> points in a decision round, and the OIL-FREE alternative costs <b>{{C.OIL_FREE_COST}}</b>. If you bid <b>6,000</b>, your chance of winning the OIL option is 60%.<br><br>
        A random number between <b>0</b> and <b>{{C.BID_MAX_THRESHOLD}}</b> will determine the outcome:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>If you lose the bid:</b> You will pay {{C.OIL_FREE_COST}} in each of the next 5 rounds.</li>
        <li><b>If you win the bid:</b> 
    {{ if player.is_control }}
    You will pay the OIL cost (3456) plus your bid (6000), totaling <b>9,456 points</b> in the decision round. In the 4 subsequent rounds, the OIL cost will fluctuate unpredictably, making your total cost and earnings uncertain.
    {{ else }}
    You will pay the OIL cost (3456) plus your bid (6000), totaling <b>9,456 points</b> in each of the 5 rounds.
    {{ endif }}
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Remember, each round starts with an endowment of <b>{{C.ENDOWMENT}}</b> points to cover your costs. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>If you lose the bid:</b> Your earnings per round will be <b>1,000 points</b>, that is {{C.ENDOWMENT}} - {{C.OIL_FREE_COST}}.</li>
        <li><b>If you win the bid:</b> Your earnings will depend on the OIL cost and your bid.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Note: The oil cost in the game is based on normalized monthly crude oil prices to simulate realistic market dynamics. It reflects the oil cost inclusive of a fixed tax.
    </p>

    <h2>Final Survey</h2>
    <p>
        After completing the game, you will answer a survey about your willingness to support carbon pricing policies. These policies aim to provide pricing certainty alongside promoting cleaner alternatives and reduce carbon footprints.
    </p>

    <h2>Payment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Flat Fee: $2 USD</b> — For completing the game and survey, you will receive a flat fee of $2 USD.</li>
        <li><b>Bonus Opportunity (0 to $2 USD):</b> You can earn up to an additional $2 USD bonus on top of your flat fee. Your bonus is determined by your total payoff in the game, as calculated below:<br>
            <b>Bonus Payoff = $2 USD × (Your Total Score) / {{C.BONUS_MAX_POINTS}}</b>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Good Luck!</h2>
    <p>
        Thank you for participating in this experiment. Your decisions will help us better understand the relationship between carbon pricing and the adoption of sustainable measures.
