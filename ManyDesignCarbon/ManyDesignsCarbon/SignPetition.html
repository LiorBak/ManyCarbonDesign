    <h2>Petition for Fair and Stable Carbon Pricing Mechanisms</h2>
    <p>Personal as it is, this petition is an express request born from my profound concern for the effects of climate change on our planet and a deep-seated hope for a significant change. A realistic and accountable measure to tackle this issue is to advocate for the introduction, or substantial increase, of the price of carbon, which directly aligns with the ultimate objective of advancing towards social carbon pricing. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (2023) suggested that the minimum carbon price that incorporates all social costs would equate to approximately $1.00 per gallon of gasoline.</p>
    <p>The journey towards a greener future starts with accepting a new economic model that places an obligatory price on carbon in order to factor in the unaccounted environmental, social, and economic costs of carbon emission. A fixed carbon price, setting it for long-term periods inclusive of the tax in it, enhances certainty and incentivizes businesses and consumers to transition to cleaner alternatives and reduce their carbon footprints.</p>
    <p>Through this petition, I invite you to join me in requesting our decision-makers to implement fair carbon pricing which is essential for pushing us closer to a sustainable environment. Please show your support â€“ sign the petition to advocate for carbon pricing and let us make a world of difference together. This petition will be submitted to the Senate and House majority and minority leaders, as well as both Senators from New York, among other leaders in decision makers.</p>
