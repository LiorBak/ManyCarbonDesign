    The random threshold for bid acceptance in this round was <b>{{player.random_threshold}}</b>.
    Your bid was <b>{{player.bid_for_oil}}</b>. <br>Thus
    {{ if player.purchase_oil }}
         your bid was <b>accepted</b>. Hence, you received the <b>OIL</b> option
    {{ else }}
        your bid was <b>not accepted</b>. Hence, you received the <b>OIL-FREE alternative</b>

    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>
        Based on the above:
        {{ if player.purchase_oil }}
        <ul>
            <li>Your bid was <b>accepted</b>. Thus you received the <b>OIL</b> option for all 5 rounds.</li>
            <li>Your gain for the <b>decision round is {{desicion_round_gain}}</b>.</li>
        </ul>
            {{ if player.is_control }}
            <ul>
                <li>However, since the oil price fluctuated, your gains in the subsequent rounds were different.
                <br>Over all 5 rounds your <b>average gain is {{avg_gain}} points</b>.</li>
            </ul>
            {{ else }}
            <ul>
                <li>Although the cost of oil fluctuated in subsequent rounds, it did not affect your gains. This is because the oil taxation policy ensured that the price remained fixed at the decision-round level.<br>
                    Therefore, your gain in all 5 rounds was the same as in the decision round.<br>
                    <b>Without the taxation policy</b>, you would have paid according to the fluctuating prices. In that scenario, your average gain <b>would have been {{avg_gain_ifnotax}}</b> points per round.</li>
            </ul>
            {{ endif }}
        {{ else }}
        <ul>
            <li>Your bid was <b>not accepted</b>. Thus you received the <b>OIL-FREE alternative</b> for all 5 rounds.</li>
            <li>The OIL-FREE alternative provided you with a gain of <b>{{oil_free_profit}}</b> in each round.</li>
        </ul>
        {{ endif }}
    </p>

    <p>
        The total payoff added to your earnings from the last 5 rounds is <b>{{player.payoff}}</b>.
